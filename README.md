# 360Â° Render Viewer
Sphere rendered with [Chunky](https://github.com/llbit/chunky), viewer made by Lemaik.

## Update
I don't use this anymore because the sphere used for the image is too low in resolution, instead I use [Kuula](https://kuula.co/profile/MadDog443).

_(It does have some constraints, but honestly the limits are hard to hit on purpose.)_
